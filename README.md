# CSProjects
Here are some of the projects that I've done throughout my CS Career. Included in the repository are the ones I'm most proud of: Gitlet, Ataxx, Ants & Snake

Gitlet:
The goal was to recreate a lighter version of git, being able to perform commit, branch and merge.

Ataxx:
A board game with text based elements and an AI to play against. The AI utilises a MinMax algorithm.

Ants:
A fun recreation of Plants vs Zombies. This was done in my introduction to computer science class at college.

Snake:
Snake recreated with efficient memory management in C.
