# A test that I have created
# Power. Up. Power.

# I was actually two years old
# when I was given my first go-kart.

# Power, power, power, power!
# Run! Run! Come on. Push, push, push.

# My name is Carlos Sainz,
# I drive for Renault Sport Formula One.

# Faster feet. Come on.
# Faster, faster, faster...

# Born in Madrid, Spain.

# Smash it against the wall.
# Come on.

# When I was nine years old,

# I remember seeing Fernando Alonso
# winning the World Championship.

# In 2005, I meet Fernando Alonso
# in the Spanish Grand Prix.

# I remember going back home
# and saying to my dad,

# I want to be like Fernando Alonso.

# I want to be a Formula One driver."

# I hope one day I can add my name
# to the list of Spanish drivers
